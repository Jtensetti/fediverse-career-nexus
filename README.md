A community-driven, federated job board designed for the open web.

Built with ❤️ on [Lovable.dev](https://lovable.dev), **Fediverse Career Nexus** is robust enough to scale, but still open for improvement. It’s an experiment — and a mission — to make professional discovery possible across federated networks.

> ✊ This is not just a job board — it’s a declaration of independence from centralized platforms.

*Professional networking & job board that speaks ActivityPub*

React (Vite) ──supabase-js──► Edge Functions (Deno)
     ▲                                │
     │ WebSocket realtime             │ POST (HTTP Sig)
     ▼                                ▼
  Postgres  ◄── RLS, policies ── federation_queue_* (partitioned)
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone & install
pnpm i

# 2. Configure environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit `.env` with your Supabase URL and anon key

# 3. Start Supabase + React app
supabase start
pnpm dev

# 4. Deploy Edge Functions (prod)
supabase functions deploy \
  actor inbox outbox follower-batch-processor
```

Deploy the React build to Vercel/Netlify/Cloudflare Pages. Add a proxy so `https://bondy.example/actor/:user` ↔ Edge Function.
